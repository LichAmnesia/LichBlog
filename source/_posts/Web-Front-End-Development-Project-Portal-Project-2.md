## 1. Project 2 Milestone 1
### Description of project
The goal of this project is to search near nearby restraunts with Yelp data API and then show these locations in the Google Map. User can type in the search bar to search restraunts. I will use Google Map API to show the restraunts based on the results of Yelp. 

The original design is:
- User came to the website, show the nearby restraunts.
- User search restraunts, show the results returned by Yelp and show in the Google Map.
