## **Players in the Online Advertising Industry**

- **Buyers (Top and Mid-Small Advertisers, DSP)**: The backbone of the industry, these players range from large corporations to small and medium-sized businesses. The latter often leverage Search Engine Marketing (SEM) for visibility and reach.
- **Ad Networks**: These are platforms like Google, which provide a vast inventory of ad spaces. They cater primarily to small websites looking to sell ad positions. While these networks deal with long-tail traffic, the quality of this traffic isn't always guaranteed. They often operate as 'closed' networks with exclusive rights to their inventory.
- **Ad Exchange: The Open Marketplace.** Ad Exchanges create a more open market, connecting buyers (like advertisers, ad networks, trading desks, and DSPs) with sellers (publishers). This setup facilitates the connection of advertisers on a Demand-Side Platform (DSP) with publishers on a Supply-Side Platform (SSP).
- **Trading Desks(For Mid-Small advertisers):** Trading desks are central hubs for executing programmatic bidding, managing orders, and analyzing metrics. They play a critical role in optimizing advertising strategies and maximizing the effectiveness of ad spend.

## RTB

Real-Time Bidding (RTB) is a key process in digital advertising, where ad inventory is bought and sold in fractions of a second. It involves buyers (DSPs) and sellers (Ad Exchanges), with DSPs often integrating third-party verification for transaction settlements.

## Data

Data is a crucial element in targeting the right audience. For advertisers, this includes:

1. First-class data (advertiserâ€™s user data).
2. Second-class data (interaction with the advertiser's ads).
3. Third-party data (including expensive datasets like search engine data, social media data, offline data from airports, POS transactions, and third-party metrics analysis caused by ad interactions).

## **Industry Standards and Guidelines by IAB**

The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) offers guidelines and frameworks for programmatic RTB and OpenDirect specifications. 

OpenDirect, for instance, allows publishers to offer premium inventory to a broader range of buyers in a programmatic marketplace. 

The OpenRTB standard, integral to platforms like Google's ad exchange, streamlines the bidding process for multiple impressions.

## **Emerging Marketing Trends**

The trend in online advertising is leaning towards a data-centric approach. Advertisers are placing more importance on data, with companies creating their DSP platforms for ads. There's also a growing interest in bridging online and offline data. Also the audience targeting technologies.

## **The Most Important Technologies in Online Advertising**

1. Cookie mapping and app-to-device ID linking are crucial for identifying and tracking users across platforms. 
2. OpenRTB technology stands out as a significant advancement, streamlining the bidding process and enhancing the efficiency of ad exchanges.

## How RTB works
