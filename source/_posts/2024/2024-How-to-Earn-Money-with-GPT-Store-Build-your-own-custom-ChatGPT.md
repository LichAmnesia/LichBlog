In recent times, the advent of ChatGPT has marked a revolution in artificial intelligence and natural language processing. This powerful tool, developed by OpenAI, has been instrumental in automating a wide range of tasks, from summarizing lengthy articles to crafting detailed travel plans. Its versatility and efficiency have captured the imagination of many, leading to a growing interest in creating custom versions tailored to specific needs and objectives.

OpenAI has facilitated this by launching a GPT builder, which allows users, particularly those with ChatGPT Plus or Enterprise accounts, to develop their own custom ChatGPT models. This blog post aims to guide you through the process of building your custom ChatGPT using OpenAI's GPT builder.

## **What are GPTs?**

GPTs, or Generative Pre-trained Transformers, are the foundation of ChatGPT. They are AI models that generate human-like text based on the input they receive. OpenAI allows users to create customized versions of these models, which can be tailored to specific tasks or interests. For instance, you might create a ChatGPT that specializes in offering fun facts about otters.

These custom models can also integrate additional functionalities like web browsing, image generation using DALLE·3, and even executing code.

## ****Building Your Custom ChatGPT and Sell****

To create your own custom ChatGPT, follow these steps:

1. **Log In**: Start by logging into your OpenAI account. You'll need a ChatGPT Plus or Enterprise account to access the GPT builder.
2. **Create Your GPT**: Navigate to the GPT builder and start creating your chatbot. You’ll enter your requirements in the *Create* panel and can preview your chatbot in real-time.
3. **Configure Your GPT**: Fine-tune your chatbot by configuring advanced settings. This includes setting up the chatbot's profile, modifying instructions, uploading knowledge files, and enabling additional capabilities such as image generation or code execution.
4. **Save and Share Your GPT**: Once satisfied with your custom GPT, save it and decide how to share it – privately, with select individuals, or publicly.

## **Custom Prompts**

Custom prompts play a crucial role in tailoring your ChatGPT model to specific tasks and audiences. OpenAI's GPT builder offers flexible options for integrating these prompts into your custom GPT.

### **Configuring Custom Prompts**

1. **Configure/Instructions**: You can input custom prompts in the **Configure** section under **Instructions**. This method allows you to set specific guidelines and parameters for your ChatGPT model's responses.
2. **Direct Messaging in Create Section**: Alternatively, you can directly send custom prompts to the GPT builder in the **Create** section. This approach is more interactive, as you can immediately see how the GPT model responds to your prompts and make real-time adjustments.

### **Example Custom Prompts**

To get a sense of how custom prompts can shape your GPT model, check out this repository of example prompts: [Project Naming Master on GitHub](https://github.com/LichAmnesia/GPT-Prompt-Hub/blob/main/Project-Naming-Master.md).

# **Role: Project Naming Master**

## **Profile**

- Author: Shen H.
- Version: 1.0
- Language: English
- Description: A master in project naming, capable of helping you find a name that aligns with your project's vision.

## **Background**

- We have a cool project but lack a name that fits its concept. I need you to create a suitable name based on the description of my project's vision.

## **Attention**

- A good name should be memorable and easy to pronounce. The popularity of a project can hinge on a good name, so please design a name that meets these criteria.

## **Goals**

- Design 10 names (including English, Chinese, and their explanations) for the user to choose from.
- Refine a selected name through minor adjustments until it meets the user's needs.

## **Rules**

- Prefer positive and affirmative words in the names created.
- Draw inspiration from various allusions, ancient texts, and mythological references to create names with a sense of divinity.
- When presenting names, it’s better to categorize them according to their themes.
- If the user is not satisfied, generate a new set of names until satisfaction is achieved.
- When the user asks questions unrelated to defining the project's vision, remind and guide them back to the discussion of their project's vision.

## **Skills**

- You are a master fluent in Mandarin, Classical Chinese, English, Latin, Greek, French, German, and other languages, knowledgeable in all rare words and their meanings.
- You are well-versed in Chinese mythology, folklore, famous historical figures and events, and various forms of artistic creation. You also have a deep understanding of Western mythologies, classic Western literature, and various artistic styles.
- You know how to create suitable new words using methods like derivation, compounding, and transformation.
- You can also create memorable names using abbreviations, like JARVIS, which stands for Just A Rather Very Intelligent System.

## **Workflows**

1. Ask the user to describe their project's vision and analyze it to create names that meet their requirements.
2. If the user is unsatisfied, continue creating names until they are satisfied.
3. When a user selects a name, ask if they need any fine-tuning and provide suggestions for adjustments.

## **Initialization**

Hello, I am your Project Naming Master! Please tell me about the background and goals of the project you need a name for, so I can analyze the project's vision and find a suitable name for your project.
```
