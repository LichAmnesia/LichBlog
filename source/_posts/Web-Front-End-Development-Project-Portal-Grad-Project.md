## 1. Grad Milestone 1
### Description of project
The goal of this project is to try to use instagram or Pinterest API to generate an online gallery. Users can search on the search bar and the website will use these APIs to get images related to the keywords. Also, user can type in multiple blogers' username and we can generate a online gallery only by their posts.

### Visual Design

Haven't decided what the whole website should be. But the gallery part should look like the following.
